# vit-academics
I wrote this code in 3rd year of my Engineering, It was developed for my college Academics website.

I could'nt complete the app code, there are many parts still to be fixed.

There might be some problem is building the project due to old Gradle dependencies.
- Timetable for the student
- Grades, Marks, Subjects, Teacher, Faculty Advisor, Leave Apply
- Code quality might be terrible.
- Feel free to fork and work on it.
